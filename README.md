# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

This project is the final capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It focuses on analyzing and predicting the outcomes of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches, with the goal of determining factors that contribute to successful landings and cost efficiency.

## Project Overview

SpaceXâ€™s reusable rocket technology has significantly reduced space travel costs. However, ensuring the success of rocket landings is critical to their mission. This project uses real-world data to analyze launch outcomes and build predictive models.

## Objectives

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Gathered launch data from various sources, including APIs and web scraping.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigated patterns and trends in the data related to rocket success.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Model Development**: Developed machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Outcome Prediction**: Used models to predict whether future SpaceX launches will have successful landings.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Used API calls and web scraping to gather the Falcon 9 launch dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, feature scaling, and data cleaning.
3. **EDA & Feature Engineering**: Conducted in-depth analysis to generate insights and select key features.
4. **Modeling**: Implemented and fine-tuned models, including:
